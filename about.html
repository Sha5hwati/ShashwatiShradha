                    <p>My name is <b>Shashwati Shradha</b>.</p>
                    <p>I am from India, currently living in <b>Rapid City, South Dakota</b>.</p>

                    <p>I am a junior at <b>South Dakota School of Mines and Technology</b>.
                    I expect to graduate in December 2020 with a Bachelors of Science
                    in <b>Computer Science</b> and <b>Applied & Computational Mathematics</b>.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am a keen <b>learner</b> and a <b>problem solver</b>. I simply enjoy 
                     coding and working on new challenges. The satisfaction of <b>coding</b> a 
                     solution and watching it run to solve the problem and improve user 
                     experience is something that is fulfilling for me, and I look forward 
                     to doing it everyday.</p>
                     
                    <p><b>Besides academia</b>, I enjoy travelling, listening to music, going to
                    museums and parks, watching shows, and simply enjoy my time with 
                    the people I love.</p>
